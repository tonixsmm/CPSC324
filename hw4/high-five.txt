The high five is a hand gesture that occurs when two people
simultaneously raise one hand each, about head-high, and push, slide,
or slap the flat of their palm against the flat palm of the other
person. The gesture is often preceded verbally by a phrase like Give
me five, High five, Up top, or Slap hands. Its meaning varies with the
context of use but can include as a greeting, congratulations, or
celebration. There are many origin stories of the high five, but
the two most documented candidates are Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke of
the Los Angeles Dodgers professional baseball team on October 2, 1977,
and Wiley Brown and Derek Smith of the Louisville Cardinals men's
college basketball team during the 1978â€“1979 season.
